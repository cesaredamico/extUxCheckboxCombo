## extUxCheckboxCombo
Repository for Clint Nelissen's Ext.ux.CheckboxCombo (previously hosted at Google Code, which is closing down: https://code.google.com/p/extuxcheckboxcombo/).

Original release message on Sencha forums: https://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?93556-Ext.ux.form.CheckboxCombo

> This is very similar to Saki's LovCombo extension (http://www.extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=32692), however it extends TriggerField rather than ComboBox and uses a CheckboxGroup internally rather than templates.
> 
> Features Include: Supports mostly all the same config options as a regular combobox Works fine as a grid editor Supports keyboard navigation Tested in Chrome, FF, and IE8
> 
> getValue() will return data like 'value,value,value', and you can use setValue() similarly, ie. checkboxCombo.setValue('value,value,value');
> 
> As always, feedback is appreciated. Have fun with it!
> 
> **UPDATE 12/30/2010** Minor bug fixes Added template support to more closely mimic a regular combobox Added support for a 'change' event which bubbles the change event from the CheckboxGroup Incorporated changes submitted by @mitchellsimoens (Thanks Mitchell!)
> 
> **UPDATE 5/6/2010** Some minor speed enhancements Moved code over to Google code
> 
> **UPDATE 4/22/2010** Fixed a couple bugs, corrected issues with maxHeight, and triggerAction = 'all' Also now includes minified versions of the js and css files
